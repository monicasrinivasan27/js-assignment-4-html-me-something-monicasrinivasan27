        <h1 id="mainHeading">Reflection of our taste:</h1>
        After moving to our new house, my husband and I wanted a personal touch on our house. We started looking for projects that could reflect our ideas and listed the projects. The list is big, so I'm listing only a few items with diversification on type of project.

            <h3>Entrance with divine and pleasant feel</h3>
            <p class ="frontEntrance" id="frontEntranceMakeover">The entrance wall in our house was plain and simple. I thought to add some design to give divine and calm thoughts to everyone who comes to our home but on a low budget. As a first step, I changed the wall using laminated flooring materials and added a few brass wall decors. My husband added a custom-made table with an old make style. It looks great now, lots of my friends liked it very much. .</p>

            <h3>Living room renovation</h3>
            <p class="living" id="livingAr">Our living room was a bit old style with carpet, no recessed lights, and a dull color painted on the walls. We started the renovation in order, first electric works to avoid any drywall repairs at a later point. Then we painted the rooms for a bright look and last but not least the big oneeee, floor change. We explored multiple options, and finally, we landed with solid hardwood. We selected the classic color with wide-sized planks. The output was amazing, with the elegant look.</p>

            <h3>Repurposing old Upholstered Lounge Chair</h3>
            <p class ="lounge" id="loungeChair">During the pandemic time, the supply chain was a hassle. The demand went up for every item you are looking. I planned to change our lounge, but the wait time was long. So I have decided to upgrade my existing lounge. I changed the color and added lots of cushions to give more comfort. It turned out very well, with a great look and feel. Now this is my daughter's best place to rest.

            <h3>Lawn bed makeover</h3>
            <p class="lawn" id="lawnBed">When we bought the house, we noticed our house had lots of lawn beds which required heavy maintenance. So we have decided to switch on the low maintenance to avoid weed removal and mulch refilling yearly. As a result, we removed the old dirt, mulch and cleaned the area to add weed fabric and nice shiny river pebbles. As you can see in the picture, it looks great and is very easy to maintain.

            <h3>Paver-style patio expansion</h3>
               <p class="funParagraph" id="testP ">As we planned to expand our patio, we selected a multi-colored paver stones style to lay on our patio. It was a time-consuming task with a lot of learning and hard work. As we progressed, there were hiccups and plan changes based on environmental factors and other issues. After lots of effort and hard work in the evenings and over the weekends, we could complete our Patio work.  In return, we got a wonderful big (400+ sqft) patio. It was a great experience with great satisfaction. Our kids loved it and enjoyed playing on the patio.
